        <h2>My Journey – From Struggles to Success</h2>
        <p>I’m <span class="highlight">Josue Isaac Marroquin Sandoval</span>, but most people know me as <span class="highlight">Sway</span>. My journey into trading and financial markets wasn’t an easy one. Before I found success, I went through some of the most challenging years of my life. From personal struggles to financial uncertainty, I faced obstacles that forced me to rebuild myself from the ground up.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest turning points in my life was when I discovered trading. At first, it was overwhelming—I had no mentor, no clear direction, and I made plenty of mistakes. But over time, I obsessed over learning, studying charts, analyzing markets, and understanding risk management. I journaled my wins and losses, tracked my mindset, and kept going no matter what.</p>
        <p>I realized that financial freedom is possible, but only for those who are willing to put in the work. Trading became more than just a way to make money—it became a tool for personal growth, discipline, and long-term success.</p>
